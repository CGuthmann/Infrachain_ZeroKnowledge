2 authority nodes will start to produce block every 15s and a single 'public' node will expose a rpc endpoint.
The block explorer is available at localhost:80 (it may take a few minutes to start)
you can test the connectivity of the rpc-node with

    curl --data '{"method":"eth_getBalance","params":["0x8f04152f99d639fe427aadc32d3d9648038e8df6", "latest"],"id":1,"jsonrpc":"2.0"}' -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST localhost:8545
it should return
    {"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"result":"0x200000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000"}
